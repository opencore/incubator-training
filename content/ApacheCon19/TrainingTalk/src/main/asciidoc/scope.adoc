So, what are we actually trying to achieve?

What's in scope for the project?


== Scope

Anything, really!


== Scope

Some ideas though:

[%step]
* Slides
* Labs/Hands-on
* A tool to collect feedback from Training attendees
* Videos
* Quizzes

Basically: Content and Tooling around educating people

== Scope

We also plan to _not_ limit ourselves to Apache projects (or potentially even non-technical stuff).

If anyone fancies creating a Windows Server course we'd happily take it!


== Scope

There are a few things we do _not_ plan to do:

[%step]
* Being _the official X for Apache Y_
** This is important and it is something we need to communicate (better)
* Offering any kind of _certification_
* Documentation in the traditional sense
** We see ourselves consuming that instead and there might be some improvements we can contribute back as a result but we don't want to be a primary source of information for that kind of stuff
