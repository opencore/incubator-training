* We've created Training material for years
* Preparing hundreds of slides can be very tiresome
* Keeping them updated is even worse
** Especially when the projects move so fast!
*** Everyone: Stop working until we catch up!


== History

[%step]
* We obviously had the best material out there
** Highest quality, good quantity, nice pictures, very competent trainers
* Done this for years, for various topics
* Wanted to expand to more topics but didn't have the energy to create even one additional slide
